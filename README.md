# ü§ñ AI Robo Advisor

Welcome to your personal AI-powered investment assistant! This project aims to make professional-grade investment strategies, similar to those used by hedge funds, accessible to everyone through the power of AI.

This is the system workflow:

1. Investment Agent: collects user preferences via questionnaire and produces a structured Strategy.

2. Portfolio Agent: Translates the Strategy into a concrete ETF portfolio.

3. Analyst Agents:
    - Fees Agent: retrievesand analyze TER per holding.
    - Diversification Agent: compares and analyze portfolio vs strategy across asset class, geography, sector.
    - Alignment Agent: evaluates how holdings reflect risk tolerance, time horizon, expected returns embedded in the Strategy.
    - Performance Agent: computes CAGR, Annualized Volatility, Sharpe, Max Drawdown, Alpha, Beta and analyze if portfolio is performant.
    - Analysis Orchestrator: runs the above analyst agents and aggregates their outputs and provides a structured basis for downstream reporting.
